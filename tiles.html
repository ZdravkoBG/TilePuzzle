			How quickly can you solve it?

			American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely
			credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, Loyd claimed from 1891
			until his death in 1911 that he invented it.
			The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman,
			a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
